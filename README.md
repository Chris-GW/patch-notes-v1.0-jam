## About

You play as Murphy, the mad swordsman — a fighter whose greatest weakness has become his only weapon. Murphy must embrace his cursed fighting style to protect his family and rescue villages from plundering ducks.

- His sword swings look normal… but the damage lands seconds later.
- His ghostly afterimages confuse enemies just as much as they confuse him.
- His dash unleashes bursts of speed, but leaves him struggling to steer.


## How to Play

- Explore your homeland and rescue villages in desperate need.
- Fight relentless waves of invading ducks and master your unique fighting style.
- Survive long enough until the evil ducks are gone for good.
